## Introduction
The equitable distribution and accessibility of Veterans’ benefits are essential indicators of both social policy effectiveness and the overall well-being of the Veteran population across the United States. This report presents a county-level analysis of Veterans receiving VA Disability Compensation benefits at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2023, utilizing data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Enterprise Integration, and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). The dataset captures the total number of Veterans receiving compensation, their service-connected disability (SCD) ratings, as well as demographic factors such as age and gender. However, data suppression techniques were applied to protect the identities of individuals, leading to some missing values for specific demographic attributes. This analysis seeks to contextualize the distribution of disability compensation recipients relative to broader county-level demographic trends, urban population concentrations, and economic conditions, as measured by state-level Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for FY 2023.

To further investigate regional disparities and potential correlations between Veteran compensation rates and broader socioeconomic factors, this study will integrate external datasets, including total county population figures and major metropolitan population distributions within those counties. This approach will provide a comparative framework to assess the proportion of Veterans receiving benefits relative to the total resident population. Additionally, incorporating state-level CPI data will allow for an economic assessment of how cost-of-living variations may impact the relative adequacy of VA Disability Compensation payments in different geographic areas. Understanding these dynamics is critical for policymakers, as variations in economic conditions may influence Veterans’ financial stability and access to essential services.

This analysis will be conducted using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, leveraging robust data science tools for statistical modeling and geospatial visualization. Pandas will be used for structured data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn will facilitate the graphical representation of key trends. Possible utilization of geospatial patterns of VA Disability Compensation recipients will be explored using GeoPandas and Folium to develop interactive county-level heatmaps, highlighting areas of high and low benefit distribution. Furthermore, state-level CPI adjustments will be applied to evaluate compensation adequacy relative to regional economic conditions. These tools will collectively enable a comprehensive assessment of VA Disability Compensation distribution and provide actionable insights for future policy recommendations.

By synthesizing VA administrative data with broader demographic and economic indicators, this study aims to offer a multidimensional perspective on the accessibility and effectiveness of disability compensation benefits across U.S. counties. The findings will provide a valuable foundation for future research on Veterans' financial well-being and inform targeted policy interventions to enhance benefit delivery in regions with higher economic disparities.
